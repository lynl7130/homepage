I am a PhD student in CS at Brown University, a member of [Brown Visual Computing Group](https://visual.cs.brown.edu/). I am very fortunate to have Professor [James Tompkin](https://jamestompkin.com/) as my advisor. My research interests mainly lie in computer vison and scene understanding.

Prior to that, I received my Master in Computer Sciene from Columbia University, advised by Professor [Shih-Fu Chang](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~sfchang/) and Professor [Shuran Song](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~shurans/). I completed my Bachelor in Computer Science at Fudan University.
