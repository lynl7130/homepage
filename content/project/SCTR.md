date = "2020-12-2"

abstract = "SSCNav showed that traditional CNN networks like ResNet normally capture low semantic-level fea- tures, like completing a bedâ€™s shape after seeing part. However, a smart scene completion algorithm would have higher-level semantic understanding skills, like recognizing a region as a bedroom when a bed is present, which could be achieved by applying Transformer-based models."
