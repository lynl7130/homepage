SSCNav showed that traditional CNN networks like ResNet normally capture low semantic-level features, like completing a bed’s shape after seeing part. However, a smart scene completion algorithm would have higher-level semantic understanding skills, like recognizing a region as a bedroom when a bed is present. This could be achieved by applying Transformer-based models
